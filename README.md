this mod is heavily inspired by <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/super-crafting-frame">Super Crafting Frames</a>! Sadly the mod never made it past 1.11, but since i loved the idea behind it i made my own take on the concept.

Special thanks to EdgarEllen for the inspiration, TeamWizardry for their awesome LibrarianLib and support, and ofcourse forge for making modded possible. Special thanks to HKDragonboy for his awesome texture work!
