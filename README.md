# JustCraftingFrames

this mod is heavily inspired by <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/super-crafting-frame">Super Crafting Frames</a>! Sadly the mod never made it past 1.11, but since i loved the idea behind it i made my own take on the concept.

Special thanks to EdgarEllen for the inspiration, TeamWizardry for their awesome LibrarianLib and support, and ofcourse forge for making modded possible.
